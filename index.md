# Welcome to the Our Best Words GitHub Repository! 

My name is Laura Novich and I teach Advanced Technical Communication at Our Best Words. 
This repository was created to showcase our student's work with GitHub.

* Each assignment is explained in the [student-assignments](student-assignments/) directory.
* Each student's work is in the [student-work](student-work/) directory.

Feel free to browse and look at their work! Even better, contact me at lauran@ourbestwords.com for student information or information about the courses available at [Our Best Words](https://ourbestwords.com/).
